# AssaultonAtlantisWindows

A C++ game packaged as a Windows application using custom bitmaps rendered directly into static display memory and Windows GDI+ bitmap libraries

Game plays with arrow keys and spacebar, has two modes, and implements delta time for frame timing

The game is similar to that of the famous arcade game Sea Wolf but with a few changes. 

The player represents Poseidon, the god of the sea. You have been ordered by Zeus to attack the city of Atlantis because they have fallen out of favor with the gods. You are able to throw tridents at passing Atlantean ships but there are sea animals also passing by that should not be hurt. You must gain the highest score by sinking as many ships as possible while also not killing innocent sea creatures.
